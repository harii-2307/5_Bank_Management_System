# Bank_Management_System

The goal of this project is to develop a Bank management System that offers consumers a fictitious banking experience. Users may authenticate themselves with a  password and carry out fundamental banking activities including cash withdrawals, cash deposits, and analysing statements of transactions. While putting an emphasis on security precautions and protecting user data privacy, the project aims to deliver a realistic and user-friendly interface that replicates the interactions and operations of a physical ATM.
